## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

-   **IDE**: Visual Studio 2019 or later
-   **Framework**: .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
-   **Database Server**: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/malakwagdy/CinemaTicketBookingSystem.git
    cd CinemaTicketBookingSystem
    ```

2.  **Set up the Database:**
    -   A SQL script to create the required database schema is included in the project (`FullDBCreation.sql`).
    -   Open your database management tool (like SQL Server Management Studio).
    -   Create a new, empty database.
    -   Run the provided SQL script against your new database. This will create all the necessary tables and relationships.

    -   Navigate to the database manager file (e.g., `DatabaseManager.cs` or similar).
    -   Locate the connection string variable.
    -   **Important:** You must update the connection string to point to your local database server and the database you just created. For example:
        ```csharp
        // Before
        private string connectionString = "Server=SERVER_NAME;Database=DB_NAME;User Id=USER;Password=PASSWORD;";

        // After
        private string connectionString = "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=MyCinemaDB;Integrated Security=True;";
        ```

4.  **Build and Run the Project:**
    -   Build the solution in Visual Studio (Build > Build Solution).
    -   Run the project by pressing `F5` or clicking the "Start" button. The application should now launch and connect to your database.
